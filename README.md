## Getting started

Make sure that [pandoc-fignos](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos) is installed

``` shell
pip install pandoc-fignos pandoc-eqnos pandoc-tablenos pandoc-secnos --user
```

Currently not compatible with pandoc v.3. See this 
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-fignos/issues/105)

Although v. 3.1.1 appears to work...
