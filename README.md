## Getting started

Make sure that pandoc v.3.x.x is installed

Make sure that [pandoc-fignos](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos) is installed as follows for pandoc 3 compatibility:

``` shell
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/nandokawka/pandoc-xnos@284474574f51888be75603e7d1df667a0890504d#egg=pandoc-xnospip install pandoc-fignos ```

Standoc fignos currently not compatible with pandoc v.3. See this 
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-fignos/issues/105)


V. 3.x.x appears to work with this version of xnos:

python -m pip install git+https://github.com/nandokawka/pandoc-xnos@284474574f51888be75603e7d1df667a0890504d#egg=pandoc-xnos
